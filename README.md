# gift-matcher
This is a simple haskell program to solve the our annual gift swap.
This gift swap has some restraints and is a perfect use case of 
the Hopcroft Karp graph matching algorithm. That is still a work in 
progress on one of the branches however. Right now it simply create
a random set of pairings and then verifies that the created random 
pairs don't break the constraint that family members cannot gift
to one another
